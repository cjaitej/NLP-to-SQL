First, identify the key entities involved in the question, which are patients and their examinations.\n2. Then, extract the relevant information, i.e., patients with a normal anti-SSA test and a hospital visit before 1990.\n3. Based on the database schema, notice that the relationship between Patient and Laboratory tables is established through a join on their shared 'ID' field, which uniquely identifies each patient.\n4. Recognize that 'First Date' in the Patient table represents the date a patient first came to the hospital and is relevant to the condition 'before 1990'.\n5. Realize that 'SSA' in the Laboratory table stores the result of the anti-SSA test and should be set to '0' for normal results.\n6. Write a SQL query that joins the Patient and Laboratory tables, filters the data based on 'First Date' and SSA conditions, and uses COUNT to determine the number of patients meeting the criteria.",
